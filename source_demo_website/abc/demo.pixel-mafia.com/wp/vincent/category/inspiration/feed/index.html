Moments of Excitement. All made possible by our flavor, innovation and, most importantly, by unlocking potential in our team members.</p>
<p>With more than 50 years of experience under our belts, we understand how to best serve our customers through tried and true service principles. Instead of following trends, we set them. We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile. No matter where you find us, we’re making sure each meal our customers enjoy is delicious and one-of-a-kind.</p>
<p>Sivananda was born Kuppuswamy in Pattamadai near Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, India, as the third son to his parents on 8 September 1887. As a child he was very active and promising in academics and gymnastics. He attended medical school in Tanjore, where he excelled.</p>
<p>Ambrosia during this period. Upon graduation he practised medicine and worked as a doctor in Malaya for ten years, with a reputation for providing free treatment to poor patients.		</p>
